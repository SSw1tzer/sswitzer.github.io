        <p class="about-intro"> Hello I'm a information and technology major at georgetown college 
            this is going to be my first webpage but my second time working
            with HTML.
        </p>
        
        <p class="about-hobbies"> Some of my hobbies and interests are gaming, coding, and watching 
            movies/shows. I mainly play online games, RPGs, and survival games
            typically with friends during my downtime. Sometimes I look at 
            coding or programming and would love to get started developing
            my own small game however i'm a bit lazy. I also enjoy watching 
            shows most recently I finished the second season of Squid game which
            was an interesting ride.
